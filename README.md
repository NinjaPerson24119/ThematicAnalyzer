The objective of this software is to classify each word as a theme. The classes / themes are learned from input texts.
By classifying each word in a text as belonging to a theme, an author can develop an intuition about the thematic dynamic range of their text. For example, if an author has a tendency to use too many depressing, gloomy words, it will come across as boring. This tool allows an author to identify when they get stuck in a thematic rut.
